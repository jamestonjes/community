The way each folder will work as they're added is as follows:
maps is for maps deemed completed
wip is for only work in progress maps
layouts is for discarded levels anyone can take over if they like
textures/decals, you can guess what they have, aswell as their sourcefiles if applicable
models will have a combination of both WIP and completed models, as well as their .blend files

and all files licensed under the WTFPL v2.0 unless expicitly mentioned otherwise;
you may redistribute, copy, remake, and modify these works in whatever manner you like.
